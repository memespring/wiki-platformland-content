In theory better data and better platforms mean:

* Public/civil society can understand the implications of proposed policies
* Better, real-time data for politicians and policymakers
* Be able to ask questions and get probabilities back. Not tables of numbers.??
* Need to be published with error margins unemployment stats
* Versioning not publishing
* When the government changes tax you should be able to say what it means for an individual
* More models need to be open/inspectable
