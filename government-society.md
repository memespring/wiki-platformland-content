Platforms for government or platforms for society?


The digital payments platforms in the UK and India are so different as to nearly be incomparable. UPI in india is a society wide payments system aiming to change how anyone pays for anything digitally. While GOV.UK Pay is a platform for central, and increasingly local government[^1], to take payments are part of government services.

That is not to say one is better than the other. The choice about who gets to operate on a platform is a design choice.

Broadly speaking, platforms can be:

For single tier of government - for example a state in a federal system
Government-wide - used across central, municipal and regional government
A piece of society-wide infrastructure - for example, used in banking, or by 3rd sector organisations

UPI and GOV.UK Pay sit towards opposite ends of that spectrum:


The cloud hosting platforms, cloud.gov in the USA and GOV.UK PaaS in the UK are both limited to a single tier of government (federal and central government respectively). NIC Cloud/MeghRaj in India have devised to allow users from central government, states and districts.




Looking at identity,  login.gov in the USA provides a light-weight identity platform for federal services. GOV.UK Verify provides a similar service (with additional levels of identity verification) for central government in the UK and has been experimenting with opening the service up to local government. Aadhaar in India is being used beyond government[^2] for people to open bank account (and not without controversy given it is a centralised identity system).

Where this model breaks is with e-identity in Estonia, which though its e-residents scheme, offers use of the identity platform to people well beyond its borders[^3]
