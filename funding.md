<!-- TITLE: Funding & charging options-->

# Funding and charging options

## Central funding, free at point of use

It is important to have a plan for pivoting if central funding stops.

## Offering for free below a certain threshold

e.g. GOV.UK PAY

In some circunmstances, this might be a useful way of avoiding the 'free bar' problem.

## Cost recovery

## Legal and constitutional constraints

There may be constrains on the funding models that can be employed for certain types of users. For example, in the USA, federal agencies are precluded from charging states for services.

At the same time, certain organisations are required by law to recover costs. In the long run, this is probably not a very good model for operating platforms and registers. In the short-term it is important to understand them.


## Transaprency

Measure cost-per use and be transparent to users of the platform or register, even if they are using the platform or register for free. This is particuarly important incase you need to pivot fudnign model at some point in the future.

## What to do if ...
* **Someone senior says you must charge all users:** show them when it will cost the taxpayer more to charge for the service

## Actions:

* Calculate the thresholds for when charging for use would cost the tax-payer more than not charging because of procurement costs or meeting time
* Start measuring cost-per use
* Understand any constitutional or legal constraints about funding models for different types of users
