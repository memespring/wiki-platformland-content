<!-- TITLE: Funding & charging options-->

# Funding and charging options

## Central funding, free at point of use

It is important to have a plan for pivoting if central funding stops.

## Offering for free below a certain threshold

e.g. GOV.UK PAY

## Cost recovery


## Legal and constitutional constraints

There may be constrains on the funding models that can be employed for certain types of users. For example, in the USA, federal agencies are precluded from charging states for services.

At the same time, certain organisations are required by law to recover costs. In the long run, this is probably not a very good model for operating platforms and registers. In the short-term it is important to understand them.


## Actions:

* Calculate the thresholds for when charging for use would cost the tax-payer more than not charging because of procurement costs or meeting time
* Understand any constitutional or legal constraints about funding models for different types of users
