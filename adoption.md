## Self service

## Identifying 1st users

There are risks and oppertunities around trying to get adopted by large / high profile serivces and departments early on. It can secure the future of the platform and gives credability. It can also risk being tighltly coupled to the demands of one use case. They will also have demands around scale and robustness that it might be hard to satify at the alpha stage.


## Messaging and 'sales'

Be confident in the message that you're communicating. It's going to ‘save this much time’ or ‘it's going to be this much more valuable in terms of marginal costs’ or ‘your integration costs are going to be lower’.

Be open and transparent about costs to the government users of the platform. Help them understand the unit costs and that those costs will come down as more  government servies use the paltform. Do this even if they are not directly paying for the service (as it will help them undertsand the cost if that happens in the future).

## Openness

Be open about what you are learning through user research and observing usage.

Be clear about the value that you are delivering in terms of savings and usage.
