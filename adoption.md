## Self service

## Identifying 1st users

There are risks and oppertunities around trying to get adopted by large / high profile serivces and departments early on. It can secure the future of the platform and gives credability. It can also risk being tighltly coupled to the demands of one use case. They will also have demands around scale and robustness that it might be hard to satify at the alpha stage.
