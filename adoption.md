<!-- TITLE: Adoption -->

## Self-service

Account management does not scale.

## Identifying 1st users

There are risks and opportunities around trying to get adopted by large / high profile services and departments early on. It can secure the future of the platform and gives credibility. It can also risk being tightly coupled with the demands of one use case. They will also have demands around scale and robustness that it might be hard to satisfy at the alpha stage.

Use the early adopters to show capability and build trust. 
  

Everybody want's to be second, not first. So, give the 1st user VIP treatment.

## Growing within an organsiation

Once a platform or register has been adoption bny one team in an organisation, it is likely that others will adopt it too. This is partly because of trust, partly because any contractural problems will likely have been solved.

Find the people in the organsition who will champion the use of the platform/register and make them the hero.

## Feature requests

Don't be afraid to say no to feature requests, even from big users, if thney are not meeting a need that you have identified as common for other users.

## Messaging and 'sales'

Be confident in the message that you're communicating. It's going to ‘save this much time’ or ‘it's going to be this much more valuable in terms of marginal costs’ or ‘your integration costs are going to be lower’.

Be open and transparent about costs to the government users of the platform. Help them understand the unit costs and that those costs will come down as more government services use the platform. Do this even if they are not directly paying for the service (as it will help them understand the cost if that happens in the future).

Explain how it will make the lives of public servants easier as well as the lives of citizens.

## Openness

Be open about what you are learning through user research and observing usage.

Tell stories about why it is better and how government users are using the platform.

Be clear about the value that you are delivering in terms of savings and usage.

Publish the roadmap in the open.

## Procurement

Remove procurement from the process as much as possible.

## Show thew thing

Showing a prototype working with tghe real service is worth a million slick sales presentations.

## Open up to more parts of government and society over time.

## What to do if ...
* **Someone ask what your service level agreement is**: point them at your status page and uptime data instead

## Actions

* When you start working with a new organsiation, blog and talk about it so other teams in the same organisation know that procurement has been solved
* Map out how you will make your team avaliable to support and address concerns of the first user
* Map out users procurement pain-points and prioritise addressing them
