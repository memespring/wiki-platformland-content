## Self service

Account management does not scale.

## Identifying 1st users

There are risks and oppertunities around trying to get adopted by large / high profile serivces and departments early on. It can secure the future of the platform and gives credability. It can also risk being tighltly coupled to the demands of one use case. They will also have demands around scale and robustness that it might be hard to satify at the alpha stage.

Use the early adopters to show capability and build trust.


## Messaging and 'sales'

Be confident in the message that you're communicating. It's going to ‘save this much time’ or ‘it's going to be this much more valuable in terms of marginal costs’ or ‘your integration costs are going to be lower’.

Be open and transparent about costs to the government users of the platform. Help them understand the unit costs and that those costs will come down as more  government servies use the paltform. Do this even if they are not directly paying for the service (as it will help them undertsand the cost if that happens in the future).

Explain how it will make the lives of public servants easier as well as the lives of citizens.

## Openness

Be open about what you are learning through user research and observing usage.

Tell stories about why it is better and how government users are using the platform.

Be clear about the value that you are delivering in terms of savings and usage.

Publish the toadmap in the open.

## Procurement

Remove procuerment from the process as much as possible.

## Open up to more parts of government and society over time.
