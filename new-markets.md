<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of New Markets -->

The adoption of platforms by governments has the potential to create new markets and change existing ones.

## New contractor behaviours

Government as a platform means fewer unknowns for contractors working with government. Knowing there are common components for common problems means they can better estimate the work involved up front and budget more accurately. The known quantity that this provides also has the potential to make working with government more accessible and more attractive to work for.


## The buying power of commodity platforms

Common platforms for commodity-based services (things like messaging, printing or payments) open up several new opportunities.

Firstly, demand can be managed by swapping in new suppliers as demand rises or a falls, or if performance of one supplier drops.

Because, by definition, common platforms are about doing something once, this gives government more buying power.
