# Methods for identifying platforms

## User research with digital service teams

The UK GDS conducted 150 interviews with service teams across government. Identify teams to talk to from service assessments, reviewing or compiling lists of government services, reviewing PDF forms listed on government websites.

Having a list of all government services/transactions is important. 

Conduct interviews with teams to undertand what their service does, what needs it is meeting, what needs they would like to meet but canâ€™t, and what support they would like. Use these to compile a list of the number of services that might benefit from a particular shared capability.

## Develop institutional capability

Encorage teqms to spot potential shared capabilities, and as an organisation, invest in teams producing common components and platforms.

Use [Wardley mapping](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html) to identify potentual for shared components / existing duplicaiton.

## 'Horizon scanning'

## Code reviews

Semi-automated searches of government git repositories looking for common capabilities is a theoretical possibility.

## Desk research

Reviewing data from service assessments, legislation and lists of services looking for potentual comnmon capabilities.
