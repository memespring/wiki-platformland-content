# Methods for identifying platforms

## User research with digital service teams

The UK GDS conducted 150 interviews with service teams across government. Identify teams to talk to from service assessments, reviewing or compiling lists of government services, reviewing PDF forms listed on government websites.

Having a list of all government services/transactions is important. 

Conduct interviews with teams to undertand what their service does, what needs it is meeting, what needs they would like to meet but canâ€™t, and what support they would like. Use these to compile a list of the number of services that might benefit from a particular shared capability.

## Surveys

Brazil did a semi-mandated survey to identitfy the services the government offers.

## Develop institutional capability

Encorage teqms to spot potential shared capabilities, and as an organisation, invest in teams producing common components and platforms.

Use [Wardley mapping](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html) to identify potentual for shared components / existing duplicaiton.


## Look for underutalised resources

e.g. government printers / government offices, and wrap them in an API

## 'Horizon scanning'

## Code reviews

Semi-automated searches of government git repositories looking for common capabilities is a theoretical possibility.

## Desk research

Reviewing data from service assessments, legislation and lists of services looking for potentual comnmon capabilities.

## What to do if ...

**An idea for a specific platform or register is being pushed by someone more senior:** Go and talk to people who you think might use the platform and understand if it, or a subset of it, meet actual needs they have.



## Actions

* Create a list of services from across government and identify peopel to conduct user research with
* Blog early and often about the project and see if potentual users come forward
