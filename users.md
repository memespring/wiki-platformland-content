# Understand who your users are

## Other teams making services

The primary users of a common platform or a data register are the teams who will consume them to build services for the public, not the public themselves.

These teams will include designers and developers, but also people responsible for procurement.

## Admin users

Once your common platform or a data register has been adopted, there may be admin users.

## Citizens/end users of services

Having said the public are not the primary users, there may be ways that the public use the platform directly.

## Anti-users and misuse

There will also be actors who wish to misuse the platform.

## Platform governance and management 

The team operating the platform or register are also users.

Actions:

* Identify potential teams who might use the platform or register
* Identify the types of user in that team, including non-technical roles
* Identify the areas that citizens might interact with the platform
* Identify anti-users
* Identify the roles witching the team developing and operating the platform
