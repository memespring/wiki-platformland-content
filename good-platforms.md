<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Good Platforms -->

## Self service

* Users can get started quickly
* Users can find it, understand what it does, use it first time.
* You can use it in practical work e.g. use it in a prototype within an hour.
Remove procurement
* Conduct user research with developers to see if they understand the documentation / example code
* From private beta, you need people to sign up online so you know you’ve got the pitch right. You need to quickly take the pitch from product owner and put it on the website early.
* Sandbox environemnt for developers to try code against fake data.



## Minimise data collection

## Consider misuse / anti user needs 

## Support manual and API usage

Not all users will be programtic. Also a good way for trying out the platform.

## Support fall backs (e.g. cash payments / prove identity in person)

## Simplicity

Generally, platforms should do one thing. Avoid somehting that is too complex or tries to do too much.
