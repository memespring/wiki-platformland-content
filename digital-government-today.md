<!-- TITLE: The shape of government -->


Why are governments the shape they are? The ministries, the agencies, the inspectorates and commissions? It's a mix of concerns around the separation of powers, the practicalities of operating particular services or policies, questions of accountability and democracy, and of course, historical accident.

While digital platforms have fundamentally changed the structure of entire industries like hospitality, transport and publishing, government remains much the same as it was in the 20th Century.

Even in countries viewed as leaders in digital government, the progress towards digitisation has mostly been focused on building capability and the introduction of modern approaches to design and technology. While both critical, the digital revolution has only just begun to affect the government.

Questions about how government should be structured for the digital age - what the institutional, social and technical response should be - remain unanswered.

Digital and data risk create new power silos in government. This requires new checks and balances to keep people, and the data held about them safe.

By structuring government around shared platforms, rather than thematic agencies, there is the opportunity for politicians to deliver on their mandates faster, for public services to be dramatically improved, and for considerable savings in money and effort.

With code becoming defacto law, the use of data to derive hyper-personalised services or to make decisions previously made by humans will require new ways to explain to the public how their government works, and how they can have agency over it.

If we fail to answer these questions, we risk both negative externalities and the missed opportunity of realising the potential of the digital revolution.

It's too important to leave to historical accident.
