<!-- TITLE: What To Measure -->

# What to measure

## KPIs
* Cost per use (measure this from day one)
* The number of services using the platform or register
* The number of organsiations using the platform or register
* The user split between different levels of government (central or federal / local or state province) AND non-government use (even if this is zero for now)
* Service uptime


## Learning from usage

Platform opertors have the power to look across the platformamnd see how it is being used. e.g. looking for patterns that can be used to improve how other users use the platform or register.

With great power comes great responsibility - there may be legitimate cases for making this essentially technically impossible (e.g. GOV.UK Verify being blind to the serivces that someone was using)
