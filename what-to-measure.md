# What to measure

## KPIs
* Cost per use (measure this from day one)
* The number of services using the platform or register
* The number of organisations using the platform or register
* The user split between different levels of government (central or federal/local or state province) AND non-government use (even if this is zero for now)
* Service uptime


## Learning from usage

Platform operators have the power to look across the platform and see how it is being used. e.g. looking for patterns in implementation that can be generalised into features or used to improve how other users use the platform or register.

With great power comes great responsibility - there may be legitimate cases for making this essentially technically impossible (e.g. GOV.UK Verify being blind to the services that someone was using)
