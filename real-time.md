# Real-time government services
One of the characteristics of todayâ€™s digital service is that they operate in real-time. Government services generally do not operate in real-time.

## Causes

* Batch processes to copy and share data between parts of government
* 'Back-end' / 'back-office' processes have not been digitised

## Why real-time services?

* Proactively inform users about changes / potential changes based on data already held. e.g. child reaching school age
* Shorter feedback loop for policy / service teams
* Reduce failure demand
* Real-time adjustments to tax/benefits

## What are the risks?

* New privacy risks
* Ability to e.g. create new companies in near real-time would require new monitoring for misuse

## Examples

* Tax in Estonia
