## Causes

* Batch processes to copy and share data between parts of government
* 'Back-end' / 'back-office' processes have not been digitised

## Why real-time services?

* Proactively inform users about changes / potential changes based on data already held. e.g. child reaching school age
* Shorter feedback loop for policy / service teams
* Reduce failure demand
* Real-time adjustments to tax/benefits

* Tax in Estonia
* Companies in UK can be create programatically [^1]
