<!-- TITLE: Governence, operations and funding -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Governence -->

While in theory, any part of government could run a GaaP product for the rest of government, the capability required and the investment to run these things is high. It is also important for the incentives to align with good management of the platform for all users (not just those in the 'home' department or ministry.

## Funding options

* Central funding
* Recharging

## Incentives

If a department is delivering a program of work in a particular area, and there is an ancillary, common capability that could come from that, the ministerial priority for delivering your programme of work is always going to take precedence over delivering that common capability in a way that works for the rest of government.

## Incubation, mergers and acquisitions?

* Digitial service units as incubators of platforms that are then handed over to relevant parts of government?
* Identifying potential, existing common capabilities and mandating they are moved to a new central organisation? Or multiple capabilities merged?
* Risks if things not designed as platforms from the beginning?


## Notifying users of changes

## Mandating usage

A mandate to develop a platform is separate from mandating usage of that platform.
