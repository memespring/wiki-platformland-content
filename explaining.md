<!-- TITLE: Explaining government as a platform-->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Different strategies and mataphors -->

## The infrastructure argument

Platforms represent shared infrastructure. A modern government needs to approach digital platforms in the same way it does roads or company law.


## The technology stack

This is how Amazon, Google, Facebook do things.

## The burning platform

Genuine accountability for people who break technology platforms is coming. You have a platform of sorts today, it exists, is it up to the job? Do you think you have a security team as good as facebook? Could you spot malicious activity?


## Things we identified during transformation

While working to improve X, Y, Z services, we identified some common things that are broken.

## Duplication and cost savings

Government is doing X thing N times. It's wasting money and is confusing for citizens


## Inconstitency

Government does not have a difinitive list of companies / local authorities. 

## Building blocks

By building reusable blocks - like booking an appointment or paying for somethign - we can make it quicker and cheaper to assemble services.

Cons: It's hard to explain the parts that don't have a user-facing component such as a register of companies.

## Enabling end-to-end service redesign


## First mover oppertunity

The 1st governments to become nativly digital will have a advantage over other countries.
