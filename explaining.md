## Digital service teams are your users

Meet the needs of service teams, so that they can meet the needs of their users, and as a consequence of that, public services improve and the quality of people's experience of the state is transformed. The primary users of platforms are digital service teams elsewhere in government.

## The infrastructure argument

Platforms represent shared infrastructure. A modern government needs to approach digital platforms in the same way it does roads or company law.


## A better, digital, democracy

Digitla platforms can tranform the relationship between citizens and their government.

## The technology stack

This is how Amazon, Google, Facebook do things.

## The burning platform

Genuine accountability for people who break technology platforms is coming. You have a platform of sorts today, it exists, is it up to the job? Do you think you have a security team as good as facebook? Could you spot malicious activity?


## Things we identified during transformation

While working to improve X, Y, Z services, we identified some common things that are broken.

## Duplication and cost savings

Government is doing X thing N times. It's wasting money and is confusing for citizens


## Inconstitency

Government does not have a difinitive list of companies / local authorities. 

## Building blocks

By building reusable blocks - like booking an appointment or paying for somethign - we can make it quicker and cheaper to assemble services.

Cons: It's hard to explain the parts that don't have a user-facing component such as a register of companies.

## Enabling end-to-end service redesign


## First mover oppertunity

The 1st governments to become nativly digital will have a advantage over other countries.

## The app store

Think of it as a foundation for building other apps on top of.

## The API for government

All government services will be avaliable as APIs for people inside and outside government to build upon. Simular to the 'technology stack' metaphor.
